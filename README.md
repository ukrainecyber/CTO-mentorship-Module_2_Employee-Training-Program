# CTO Mentoring Program: Module 2

The USAID Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure in Ukraine Activity created five repositories with materials developed for CTO mentorship program in 2021.

The second module of this program contains materials on establishing and implementing a cybersecurity employee training & testing program.

You can force complex passwords, install drive encryption, and use three different types of security applications, yet, none of that matters unless you tackle the primary cause of security issues: your employees. While typically not a malicious act, employee caused security incidents are quite common, with phishing attacks accounting for 43 percent of all data breaches. 

Besides technical means, a comprehensive Security Awareness Training program is essential when it comes to your overall security plan. While many businesses conduct formal training seminars, send email updates, and even test employees on their overall security knowledge, there is one question that IT leaders often have a difficult time answering…is it working? The materials will guide you how to plan and create a cybersecurity training program for employees and resources used straight away to train and measure employees’ cybersecurity knowledge.

These materials were prepared by Catalisto LLC for the USAID Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure in Ukraine Activity.
